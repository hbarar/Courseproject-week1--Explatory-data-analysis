This repository contains four R code and corresponding (png format) images regarding the "Electrical Consumption Data " .
Atfirst the data was downloaded to the working directory which is a txt file and has 9 coloumns . 
Then to plot the requested images , we assign a new vector for each coloumns and then use command like hist for making histogram or plot for 2D plotting and also add lines to make multi lines image as well as multi images with using par() command .


# Codes 
plot1.R  ( histogram)
plot2.R  ( 2D plot )
plot3.R  ( 3 lines in one image )--legend()
plot4.R   (multiple images in one png file)--par()
